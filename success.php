						<p class="">I was in college for Business Administration when I started teaching myself frontend development. I was making progress with my self-learning but kept hitting roadblocks and didn’t have anyone to go to with questions. After reading about Codify Academy online and talking with Matt and Sam via phone calls and Skype, I knew it was what I had been looking for. I packed my bags, moved to San Francisco and haven’t looked back since. I am now a Web Designer/Frontend Developer at Vulcun, an eSports startup in the city. I look forward to going to work every morning because I get to do what I love and see real people use the things I design and build. I would not be where I am today without the ongoing support and guidance I got from Codify Academy.</p>

						<p class="">Codify Academy has been an amazing experience for me. A little about myself when I started the course I was 21 years old working dead end jobs that required little skill. I felt I was doomed to stay at these jobs until I complete my bachelors in business administration which will still take me 5 years from now. I was feeling the need to learn a new skill that will give me a high pay & find somthing that will challenge me instead of repetitivness. My search ended when I ran into Codify.</p>
						<p>Now I'm so glad I took the course & I'm never looking back. My eyes have been open to a new world that I would have never imagined being even remotely involved with in this field but now I'm hooked. Trust me you GET what you GIVE & I'm living proof including my classmates who speak of jobs they are working their way into here in SF. My classmates & I come from all kinds of different backgrounds, goals, & places in life. What brought us all together & made us into better selves was this motivation to learn how to code & make somthing of ourselves. I highly suggest checking them out & just see what happens from there it might just suprise you.</p>

						<p class="">From the start of 2014, I was still on a confusing path.I was unsure if Codify Academy was the right choice or not, But I am glad I took the leap of faith because Codify Academy's material is powerful knowledge.</p>

						<p>If you are like me and can see great opportunities from a mile away, then you will see how Codify Academy can improve your job hunting or even just make some extra money on the side.</p>

						<p>I would like to give a thanks to the Brody brothers for presenting this opportunity which has kickstarted my career and skyrocketed my personal growth. My man Chris, was not just a mentor,but a true bro. I felt relaxed and comfortable and appreciate his genuine desire to want more from life as well as share that with those around him.</p>

						<p>After the program I aggressively applied for jobs. When I got interviewed and the very following day I heard this, "I have some good news for you - YOU GOT THE JOB!!!". It was such sweet satisfaction.</p>

						<p>Thank you again Chris and to the entire Codify Academy team.</p>

						<p class="">If you're looking for a coding bootcamp where teachers and group projects force you to be present and working for 90+ hours/week and/or if your motivation to learn and grow derives from external pressure then this might not be right experience for you.</p>

						<p>Codify is all about what you make it. I personally spent every free minute eating, breathing and sleeping code and i got what i wanted: a job as a software engineer, with no prior coding experience.</p>

						<p>The mentors are incredibly nice and cool dudes that really, really care about your future, what your goals are and even help you with extra projects you wanna work on. You're not just another student in a big batch of people with a strict learning agenda. Every week they check in with you 1:1, try new things during class like getting us food and fruits while working and make sure you as a stundent are able to achieve anyting you want.</p>

						<p>"The best teachers are those who show you where to look, but don't tell you what to see." —If you have a clear goal, are ready to do whatever it takes and -- most importantly --believe you can do it, then there is no better coding bootcamp than this one. Promise. :)</p>

						<p class="">This course was great. The delivered what they promised and much more. When I started I had been trying to teach my self coding for about 2 months. I learned more in the first week than I did the entire 2 months of trying to teach myself. Now I can make full websites from scratch. In terms of the job search they were super helpful. They consulted me after every interview, phone or in person. They critiqued my resume several times, and helped me find all the best avenues to apply on. I now have an awesome job, and am making a pretty penny too. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn front end development.</p>

						<p class="">This program is awesome. The biggest factor in my decision to choose this school was because it is a part time program. It is perfect for those who do not want to quit their current jobs to go into a full time school. Most other schools offer full stack development courses for more than double the price of this one. This academy will teach you the necessary skills to get your foot in the door.</p>

						<p class="">I was a project manager and sales consultant for a sign company. There was no opportunity for advancement and higher compensation so I knew I had to make a change. That’s when I came across Codify’s website. I didn’t know anything about coding before I attended Codify Academy. With their mentorship, I learned the fundamentals of front end web development. 2 months after completing the course, I got a job as a front end web developer/designer and I am also in charge of my company’s creative department.</p>

						<p>Like any course, you get out of it what you put into it. And you will have to put a lot into it if you want to get a job. Its intense, and it isn’t easy. Taking advantage of your time in class and with your coding mentor is key. You also might be lucky enough to work on real-life projects that provides you with the opportunity to showcase your new web dev skills and add to your portfolio. In my opinion, one of the best parts of Codify is that you can still seek advise from your mentors and have a place to work on your projects even after you complete the course.</p>

						<p>If you are thinking about attending Codify Academy, I recommend doing so, but know that you will need to work your tail off to be successful. With Codify’s help, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t be.</p>
